# These file contains measured streamflow values for gauged locations in the watershed. The files are prepared to run with MESH model.

- Use MESH_input_streamflow.txt for forcing data ( GEM-CaPA, RDRS, WFDEI and WFDEI-GEM-CaPA)
- Use MESH_input_streamflow_forclimateruns.txt for climate forcing data (CanRCM4-WFDEI-GEM-CaPA)
