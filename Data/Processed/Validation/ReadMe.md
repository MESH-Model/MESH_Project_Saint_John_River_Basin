# These file contains measured streamflow values for gauged locations in the watershed. The files are prepared to run with MESH model.

- Use MESH_input_streamflow.txt for historical runs (with GEM-CaPA, RDRS, WFDEI and WFDEI-GEM-CaPA meterological forcing datasets)
- Use MESH_input_streamflow.txt for climateruns forcing (for CanRCM4-WFDEI-GEM-CaPA forcing dataset)
