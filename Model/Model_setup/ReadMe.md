# MODEL SETUP

For model benchmarking, MESH model was separately calibrated using all four meteorological forcing data (i.e., GEM-CaPA, RDRS, WFDEI, WFDEI-GEM-CaPA). The calibration period and the parameters (including initial value, and lower and upper value bounds) were kept consistent across all models for standardized comparison. The calibrated MESH parameters along with their lower and upper value ranges are provided below.

For derivation of fuure flows CanRCM4 data bias corrected by WGC (CanRCM4-WFDEI-GEM-CaPA) was used to derive the baseline (1991-2020) and future (2041-2070 and 2071-2100) hydrological conditions. The calibrated parameters from WFDEI-GEM-CaPA was used for future climate runs.

## The five model runs (for GEM-CaPA, RDRS, WFDEI, WFDEI-GEM-CaPA and CanRCM4-WFDEI-GEM-CaPA) are located in Graham,
